# Tox21 Concentration Response Browser

A browser designed to display concentration response data from Tox21.

A summary of activities are found in a related application, the [Tox21 activity profiler](/tox21-activity-browser/).

## Quick start

1. Paste a list of CAS numbers or other chemical identifiers in the "Compound loader". For example:

        83-79-4
        23541-50-6
        77-40-7

2. Select at least one pathway. For example, select:

        activation_p53
        agonism_ER/full

### Required inputs

#### Compound loader

please input either CAS or Tox21 ID. For chemical properties of compounds, please see the **Input compounds** tab.

#### Assays

Click + Control/Shift allows to select multiple assays. For the descriptions of assays, please see the **Assays** tab.

***

### Other settings

#### Assay display modes

  * assay parallel
  * assay overlaid
  * assay parallel + cmpd overlaid

#### Assay readout options

  * run1/run2/run3: the result from different batches
  * cytotoxicity: counter-screen, cell viability assay, will only display when primary assay & run information are selected
  * BLA-signal/background: the signal channel or the background channel in two-channel assays (e.g. beta-lactamase assay)
  * AutoF-red/blue/green: counter-screen, the measurement type in the auto-fluorescence assay. Please combine with the primary assay option (autofluor\_hek293 or autofluor\_hepg2).

#### Line plotting options

  * raw: the normalized (against positive/negative control) data provided by NCATS
  * curvep: the Curvep results
  * Hill 4-point: the results based on 4-point Hill model provided by NCATS
    * cross outliers: the outliers are defined by Hill 4-point fitting results (may not work for certain data)
  * use color template for reporting (purple for the primary assay and black for the cell viaiblity assay)

***

### Formatting and outputs
#### Resize plot image

  * width
  * height

#### Resize axes

  * Manually adjust x-axis (unit: log10(M))
  * Manually adjust y-axis (unit: %)

#### Save data

  * save melted data: the data can be used in other software (e.g., GraphPad Prism)
  * save plot: pdf file
  * If the assay does not have a PubChem AID in Assays tab, the data cannot be downloaded.

***

### Tips

  * use the resize scroll bar if the size of the plot is not optimal
  * For a quick plot in powerpoint, use the right click "copy image" and paste into powerpoint or Paint for editing
  * For downloading results for many compounds (n > 20), click "save plot" or "save melted data" directly

### Known bugs

  * It does not recognize Tox21\_xxxxxx\_01 alone. Please add some other IDs.
