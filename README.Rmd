## A R Shiny interface to explore the Tox21 concentration-response data

### Requirement

* firefox or chrome browser with the link on NIEHS internal JOBS server [JOBS](http://jobs.niehs.nih.gov:3838/myapps/curves/) orRstudio public Shiny server [shinyapps.io](https://hsiehjh.shinyapps.io/tox21curvebrowser)

or

* download the shiny app from [CurveVisualizationGUI4Tox21](https://github.com/moggces/CurveVisualizationGUI4Tox21) & contact [Jui-Hua Hsieh](mailto:juihua.hsieh@gmail.com) for background data

```{r eval=FALSE }
library(shiny)
runApp()
```

***
### Primary input

#### Assays

Click + Control/Shift allows to select multiple assays. For the descriptions of assays, please see the **Assays** tab. 

#### Mode

  * assay parallel
  * assay overlaid
  * assay parallel + cmpd overlaid

#### Compound loader

please input either CAS, NCGC ID, or Tox21 ID. For chemical properties of compounds, please see the **Input compounds** tab.


***

### Secondary input

#### Assay readout options

  * run1/run2/run3: the result from different batches
  * cytotoxicity: counter-screen, cell viability assay
  * BLA-signal/background: the signal channel or the background channel in two-channel assays (e.g. beta-lactamase assay)
  * AutoF-red/blue/green: counter-screen, the measurement type in the auto-fluorescence assay. Please combine with the primary assay option (autofluor\_hek293 or autofluor\_hepg2). 
  
#### Curve fitting options

  * raw: the normalized (against positive/negative control) data provided by NCATS
  * curvep: the Curvep results
  * Hill 4-point: the results based on 4-point Hill model provided by NCATS
  
#### Resize plot image

  * width
  * height
  
#### Save

  * save melted data: the data can be used in other software (e.g., GraphPad Prism)
  * save plot: pdf file
  * If the data haven\'t been released to PubChem, they won\'t be able to download

***

### Tips

  * use the resize scroll bar if the size of the plot is not optimal
  * For a quick plot in powerpoint, use the right click \"copy image\" and paste into powerpoint
  * For downloading results for many compounds (n > 20), click \"save plot\" or \"save melted data\" directly
